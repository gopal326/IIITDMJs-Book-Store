# IIITDMJs-Book-Store
IIIDMJ's Book Store is a project to provide a platform to IIITDMJ's students for buying books. 


The users can explore through a variety of categories and sub-categories to choose a book. For each book there is a description of the book along with a cover and details like: Name, ISBN, Publisher, Edition, Pages & Price.

For purchasing a book, the user has to login. In case the user doesn't has an account, they will be taken to the register page. Once logged in, the user can add items to the cart and can do actions like adding, removing & re-calculation of price. After confirming & proceeding, the user is taken to Shipping details page. Finally after filling the Shipping details, the user is taken to the Payment page having various options for payment. In case a user needs to contact to admin, the user can contact via Contact us page.

For admin, the admin has to login via this credential(username: admin, password: admin123). The admin has the option to add/remove a category, subcategory & books. The admin can also view the contact page, where the users who have filled the contact us page are listed along with their query. 

The technologies used in this project are: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.
